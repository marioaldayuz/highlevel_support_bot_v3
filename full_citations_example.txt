These fields cover essential data points such as contact names, email addresses, phone numbers, appointment details (e.g., time and date), and more. Unlike Custom Fields, these fields are built-in and cannot be modified or deleted. Below are some use cases for standard fields:\n\n* **Contact First Name**: The first name of the contact.\n\n* **Contact Email**: The contact\'s email address.\n* **Appointment Date and Time**: The scheduled date and time of an appointment.\n* **User Full Name**: The full name of the assigned user.\n* **Company Name**: The name of your business or organization.\n\n_![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155038180066/original/1UpnxGaeBpxPQ0iwghG44AfA39DpxSSQ.gif?1733951039)_\n[**Click here if you\'d like to see a list of the Standard Merge Fields.**][11]\n\n⚠️ _Please be aware that some fields may be missing from the list_ ⚠️\n---\n\n## **Custom Fields**\n\nUser-defined data points unique to each contact or opportunity, used to store personalized information like birthdays or preferences for detailed segmentation and communication.

These options determine the field\'s behavior, appearance, and file handling capabilities.\n\n**Key Configuration Options**\n\n* **File Type**: Specifies the types of files users can upload, including PDF, DOC/DOCX, JPG/JPEG, PNG, GIF, and XLS/CSV.\n* **File Restriction**: Sets the maximum file size allowed for uploads, which is 250MB per file.\n* **Allow Multiple Files**: Defines whether users can upload a single file or multiple files, with the option to specify the maximum number of files.\n* **Object Type**: Determines the category where the custom field will be applied, including Contact, Opportunity, Company, and Surfboards.\n* **Group Tab**: Organizes the custom field within a specific section or grouping in the system for better visibility and usability, such as Contact Information, General Info, or Additional Info.\n\n**Finalizing the Custom Field**\n\nOnce the configuration options are set, the field must be saved to finalize the creation process. The saved field will appear in the Custom Fields Section of the selected object, such as a contact profile.',

        content: '# **Step 2:** Prepare CSV for HighLevel Import\n\n* **Check Date Formats:** Ensure all date fields in the CSV are in the YYYY-MM-DD format. This is essential for compatibility with HighLevel.\n* **Encode Special Characters:** Make sure the CSV file uses UTF-8 character encoding to properly handle special and accented characters.\n* **Clean Up Data:** Remove any line breaks, emojis, and unnecessary special characters from the file. This step helps prevent import errors.\n\n* **Recreate Custom Fields:** Log in to HighLevel and navigate to Contacts > Settings > Custom Fields. Add custom fields to store contact data in a similar way to how they were stored in Wix.\n\n### **Step 3:** Import Contacts into HighLevel\n\n* **Log in to HighLevel:** Navigate to the Contacts section using the left-hand menu.\n* **Start Import Process:** Click the Import Contacts button.\n* **Upload CSV File:** Select and upload the prepared CSV file.\n* **Map Fields:** HighLevel will prompt you to map the fields from the CSV file to the corresponding fields in HighLevel. For example, map “First Name” in the CSV to “First Name” in HighLevel.\n* **Assign Tags and Lists:** During the import process, you can assign contacts to specific lists and apply\n\n# **Step 3:** Import Contacts into HighLevel\n\nsign contacts to specific lists and apply tags. Consider applying a tag that indicates the source of the contacts, such as “Imported from Wix.”\n* **Complete Import:** After mapping all fields and setting tags/lists, click Import. HighLevel will process the import, and the contacts will be added to your account.\n\n**Field Mapping Tip:** Ensure all required fields are correctly mapped. If a field in your CSV does not have a corresponding field in HighLevel, you may need to create a custom field in HighLevel before proceeding.',
