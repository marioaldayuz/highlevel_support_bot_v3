I can definitely help you with support.\nbot: What would you like to do?\nuser: Start Chat Support\nbot: Hello! üôÇ How can I help you today?\nuser: Where do I find workflows\nbot: To find and manage workflows in HighLevel, follow these steps: \n \n1. **Go to the Automations tab** in your HighLevel dashboard. \n2. Click on **\"Workflows\"** to view all your existing workflows„Äê0„Äë„Äê4„Äë„Äê11„Äë. \n3.

Workflows save you time by running these actions automatically, such as sending emails, updating records, or notifying your team, so you don‚Äôt have to do them manually„Äê0„Äë„Äê1„Äë„Äê2„Äë. \n \nEach workflow has two main parts: \n- **Triggers:** What starts the workflow (like a form submission or a new contact). \n- **Actions:** The tasks that happen automatically (like sending emails or updating CRM data)„Äê1„Äë„Äê2„Äë„Äê23„Äë. \n \nWould you like to see examples of common workflows or learn how to create one? üôÇ\nbot: I'm still learning!
